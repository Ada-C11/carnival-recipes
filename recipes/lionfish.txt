Kari's Sausage & Red Pepper Pasta
---------------------------------
Ingredients:
1/2 (19 oz.) package Italian sausage (hot, sweet, or mild)
1/2 Tbsp dried basil
1/4 tsp crushed red pepper (optional)

1. Add the vegetable oil and sausage links (unsliced) to a large pot.
3. While the sausage is cooking, thinly slice the bell peppers and onions, and mince the garlic.
8. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and cook the pasta for about 7 minutes, or just until tender, but still firm. Slightly undercook the pasta as it will continue to cook and soak up liquid once added to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
9. Once the pasta is finished cooking, drain it in a colander and then add it to the pot with the sausage and peppers.
2 medium green bell peppers
